#Quiz 2: Lists and flow control  
Assume these variable definitions at the start of each question.  
```
a = [1,3,5]
b = [0,-1,7]
c = (2,4,8)
d = (3,9,27)
```

Provide the output of the following operations. If the operation results in an error, put 'Exception'.
1. ```a.extend(b)
print a,```
2. ```a + b
print a,```
3. ```while a:
    print a.pop(),```
4. ```for a in b:
    print a,```
5. ```a[0] = c
print a```
6. ```c[0] = a
print c```
